 I am a __FCAI Research Fellow__ at Aalto University, a 5-year position funded by the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://fcai.fi). I work with groups

- [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/) (Prof. Harri LÃ¤hdesmÃ¤ki)
- [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) (Prof. Samuel Kaski)

<br>
I am also a member of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) AI network, affiliated with [ELLIS Institute Finland](https://www.ellisinstitute.fi/about).

<br>
My interests span:
- *Biology-Informed Machine Learning*: blending flexible data-driven approaches and mechanistic models within Systems Biology
- Bayesian Inference, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization.

<br>
Besides, for a few years now, I have been cultivating a passion for indoor bouldering, with a mild success thus far ðŸ«
