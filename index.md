 I am a __FCAI Research Fellow__ at Aalto University, a 5-year position funded by the [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://fcai.fi). I work with groups

- [Computational Systems Biology](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/csb/) (Prof. Harri LÃ¤hdesmÃ¤ki)
- [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) (Prof. Samuel Kaski)

<br>
I am also a member of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) AI network, affiliated with [ELLIS Institute Finland](https://www.ellisinstitute.fi/about).

<br>
My interests span:
- *Biology-Informed Machine Learning*: blending flexible data-driven approaches and mechanistic models within Systems Biology
- Bayesian Inference, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Optimization.

<br>

I obtained my PhD in February 2022 from Ecole polytechnique, Inria and Institut Curie, under the supervision of [FranÃ§ois Fages](http://lifeware.inria.fr/wiki/Fages/HomePage) and [Annabelle Ballesta](http://annabelle.ballesta.fr/). The manuscript can be
found [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022IPPAX011) and the slides [here]({{ '/assets/pdfs/defense.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}. A detailed CV can be found [here]({{ '/assets/pdfs/cv.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"} (Last updated: April 2025).

Besides, for a few years now, I have been cultivating a passion for indoor bouldering, with a mild success thus far ðŸ«
