As such, they constitute one of the workhorses of Bayesian Inference for regression, classification, or even black-box optimization tasks. GPs have been successfully applied to the prediction of treatment effect, for inferring covariate effects from longitudinal data, or to predict whether T cells receptors can recognize specified epitopes. In this talk, I will cover the basics about GPs, highlight several analogies with other statistical methods and mention some extensions to handle complex behaviors like heterogeneity or non-stationarity. Next, I will discuss how GPs can aid for inferring partially known mechanistic models, based on heterogeneous data. Such models could describe the dynamics of antibodies response, for instance. The idea is to augment our current knowledge of the dynamics with GPs to account for unknown behaviors, but in a nonparametric fashion, thus providing an alternative to the classical nonlinear mixed effect framework.","tags":[],"title":"Gaussian Processes for the inference of partially known mechanistic models used for clinical trial data analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684159200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684159200,"objectID":"e6ad84754a79416323e02adb19447294","permalink":"/talk/mlcs_may_23/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mlcs_may_23/","section":"talk","summary":"Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing black-box, expensive-to-evaluate functions. Over the past decade, many algorithms have been proposed to integrate cheaper, lower-fidelity approximations of the objective function into the optimization process, with the goal of converging towards the global optimum at a reduced cost. This task is generally referred to as multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO). However, MFBO algorithms can lead to higher optimization costs than their vanilla BO counterparts, especially when the low-fidelity sources are poor approximations of the objective function, therefore defeating their purpose. To address this issue, we propose rMFBO (robust MFBO), a methodology to make any GP-based MFBO scheme robust to the addition of unreliable information sources. rMFBO comes with a theoretical guarantee that its performance can be bound to its vanilla BO analog, with high controllable probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on a number of numerical benchmarks, outperforming earlier MFBO methods on the most unreliable sources. We expect rMFBO to be particularly useful for including the varying expertise of human experts in Bayesian optimization processes in a reliable manner.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Unreliable Information Sources","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675328400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675328400,"objectID":"fc4be597d1eafb94638daca6de36fb53","permalink":"/talk/bph_feb_23/","publishdate":"2023-02-02T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bph_feb_23/","section":"talk","summary":"Many health sciences related tasks involve limited amounts of data : pharmacogenetics, drug design, clinical trial design, etc. These are typically not well-suited for modern AI algorithms. To circumvent this issue, human feedback can be leveraged, provided it is accounted for in the statistical models, and that efficient strategies facilitate its collection. The field of research spanned by these topics is called Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning (HITL-ML). The aim of this presentation is to illustrate several contributions in this area. As a gentle introduction, I will begin with a study from colleagues in my team, incorporating expert feedback to improve genomic-based predictions. Next, I will introduce an algorithm dealing with unreliable information sources in the framework of Bayesian Optimization, thus allowing to leverage human experts of unknown relevance. I will conclude with some work in progress, regarding the application of HITL-ML tools in the context of de novo drug design.","tags":[],"title":"Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning for Health","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672741800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672741800,"objectID":"cbfa2e14b5152347909d5f034e7f80a2","permalink":"/talk/cristal_jan_23/","publishdate":"2023-01-03T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cristal_jan_23/","section":"talk","summary":"Inferring chemical reaction networks (CRN) from time series data is a challenge encouraged by the growing availability of quantitative temporal data at the cellular level. This motivates the design of algorithms to infer the preponderant reactions between the molecular species observed in a given biochemical process, and help to build CRN model structure and kinetics. Existing ODE-based inference methods such as SINDy resort to least square regression combined with sparsity-enforcing penalization, such as Lasso. However, when the input time series are only available in wild type conditions in which all reactions are present, we observe that current methods fail to learn sparse models. We present Reactmine, a CRN learning algorithm which enforces sparsity by inferring reactions in a sequential fashion within a search tree of bounded depth, ranking the inferred reaction candidates according to the variance of their kinetics, and re-optimizing the CRN kinetic parameters on the whole trace in a final pass to rank the inferred CRN candidates. We first evaluate its performance on simulation data from a benchmark of hidden CRNs, together with algorithmic hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, and then on two sets of real experimental data: one from protein fluorescence videomicroscopy of cell cycle and circadian clock markers, and one from biomedical measurements of systemic circadian biomarkers possibly acting on clock gene expression in peripheral organs. We show that Reactmine succeeds both on simulation data by retrieving hidden CRNs where SINDy fails, and on the two real datasets by inferring reactions in agreement with previous studies","tags":[],"title":"Reactmine - a search algorithm for inferring chemical reaction networks from time series data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645192800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645192800,"objectID":"4d9fbe44ddb456e8450496bfa9edbdfa","permalink":"/talk/defense_feb_18/","publishdate":"2022-02-18T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/defense_feb_18/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On learning mechanistic models from time series data with applications to cancer chronotherapies","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629805500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629805500,"objectID":"1f8b80a3499f87a2cd3c040beb4447f7","permalink":"/talk/cemracs_august_21/","publishdate":"2021-08-24T11:45:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cemracs_august_21/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Metamodeling for metabolic models, application to a PDE model of Salmonella infection","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618578000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618578000,"objectID":"fe13296418017a9505e32acd14c1b3c3","permalink":"/talk/bioss_april_21/","publishdate":"2021-04-16T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bioss_april_21/","section":"talk","summary":"Personalized medicine aims at providing patient-tailored therapeutics based on multi-type data towards improved treatment outcomes. Chronotherapy that consists in adapting drug administration to the patient's circadian rhythms may be improved by such approach. Recent clinical studies demonstrated large variability in patients' circadian coordination and optimal drug timing. Consequently, new eHealth platforms allow the monitoring of circadian biomarkers in individual patients through wearable technologies (rest-activity, body temperature), blood or salivary samples (melatonin, cortisol), and daily questionnaires (food intake, symptoms). A current clinical challenge involves designing a methodology predicting from circadian biomarkers the patient peripheral circadian clocks and associated optimal drug timing. The mammalian circadian timing system being largely conserved between mouse and humans yet with phase opposition, the study was developed using available mouse datasets. We investigated at the molecular scale the influence of systemic regulators (e.g. temperature, hormones) on peripheral clocks, through a model learning approach involving systems biology models based on ordinary differential equations. Using as prior knowledge our existing circadian clock model, we derived an approximation for the action of systemic regulators on the expression of three core-clock genes: _Bmal1_, _Per2_ and _Rev-Erb_. These time profiles were then fitted with a population of models, based on linear regression. Selected models involved a modulation of either _Bmal1_ or _Per2_ transcription most likely by temperature or nutrient exposure cycles. This agreed with biological knowledge on temperature-dependent control of _Per2_ transcription. The strengths of systemic regulations were found to be significantly different according to mouse sex and genetic background.","tags":[],"title":"Model learning to identify systemic regulators of the peripheral circadian clock","type":"talk"}]
