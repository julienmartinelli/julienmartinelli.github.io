While the traditional approach in Systems Biology assumes a model and uses the available data to calibrate its parameters, our aim here is to develop new ___Machine Learning techniques in order to directly learn both the model and its parameters from the observations. These techniques are applied to learn interactions between the circadian clock and non invasive biomarkers such as the temperature or rest-activity rhythm, in the context of cancer\u0026rsquo;s chronotherapy.\n  Teaching:\n 2019-2021: Teaching Assistant • 2nd year BSC • Université de Paris  Real Analysis (42h) Multivariate Functions (18h)   2018-2019: Teaching Assistant • 1st year BSC • Université de Paris  Mathematics and Calculus (60h)      ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/julien-martinelli/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/julien-martinelli/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student at both Inria and Inserm, working under supervision of François Fages and Annabelle Ballesta\n  Research: My PhD focuses on the predicament of learning mechanistic models from time-series data.","tags":null,"title":"Julien Martinelli","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Julien Martinelli","Jeremy Grignard","Sylvain Soliman","François Fages"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598105289,"objectID":"ec795d9d3db58d0af28632e1803faa8d","permalink":"/publication/mgsf-19-icmlcb/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T14:08:09.689132Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mgsf-19-icmlcb/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Statistical Unsupervised Learning Algorithm for Inferring Reaction Networks from Time Series Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julien Martinelli","Jeremy Grignard","Sylvain Soliman","and François Fages"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598105289,"objectID":"00dcad6f809faf6ad6b15d310e0b463c","permalink":"/publication/mgsf-19-cmsb/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T14:08:08.216557Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mgsf-19-cmsb/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On Inferring Reactions from Data Time Series by a Statistical Learning Greedy Heuristics","type":"publication"}]
