While the traditional approach in Systems Biology assumes a model and uses the available data to calibrate its parameters, our aim here is to develop new Machine Learning techniques in order to directly learn both the model and its parameters from the observations. We focus on medical applications such as Cancer\u0026rsquo;s Chronotherapy.\n  Teaching:\n 2019-2021: Teaching Assistant • 2nd year BSC • Université de Paris  Real Analysis (42h) Multivariate Functions (18h)   2018-2019: Teaching Assistant • 1st year BSC • Université de Paris  Mathematics and Calculus (60h)      ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/julien-martinelli/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/julien-martinelli/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD student at both Inria and Inserm, working under supervision of François Fages and Annabelle Ballesta\n  Research: My PhD tackles the predicament of learning Mechanistic Models from time-series data.","tags":null,"title":"Julien Martinelli","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.
