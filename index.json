While the traditional approach in Systems Biology assumes a model and uses the available data to calibrate its parameters, our aim here is to develop new Machine Learning techniques in order to directly learn both the model and its parameters from the observations.

Using a clustering-based method, we develop an algorithm for the inference of biological reaction network. The output is a set of reactions providing us with biological understanding, and which can be used to generate new traces. A model selection method is derived from these newly generated traces. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm on a range of models from Biomodels and discuss its benefits and limits, specifically in the case of subsampled data.","tags":[],"title":"Unsupervised learning of chemical reaction networks from time-series data","type":"talk"}]
